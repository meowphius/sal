SAL (Stephe's Ada Library, or Standard Ada Library :) is a collection
of packages providing basic data structures; lists, stacks, binary
trees, dynamic arrays, etc. Each package is a generic, providing
maximum flexibility in the types that may be used with the package.
There are both tagged (polymorphic/dispatching) and non-tagged data
types, so you can use the one that fits your application best.

There is also a complete set of packages for spacecraft or robotics
math.

And an implementation of Grace Config_Files.

And lots of other stuff :).

See http://www.toadmail.com/~ada_wizard/ada/sal.html for more info,
and for the latest release.
