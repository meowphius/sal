% Basic design of these macros: need to change the catcodes before the
% parameters are read. Therefore the parameter is specified in a
% lower-level macro, which is parsed after the catcode is changed. The
% space after \@salbegincatcodes is necessary; it forces the break in
% parsing. 

% I'm not clear how to set the catcode for `\ or`\#; use \dlcode or \dlfile,
% or \verb, for names containing those.

% These macros don't work in section headings or description lists;
% use \dlfile, \dlcode for those

\def\@salbegincatcodes{\begingroup\catcode`\_=12\catcode`\~=12\catcode`\|=12}

%\file{filename} % show text as file path
\def\file{\@salbegincatcodes \@file}
\def\@file#1{\texttt{#1}\endgroup}

%\code{text} % show text as source code
\def\code{\@salbegincatcodes \@code}
\def\@code#1{\texttt{#1}\endgroup}

%\menu{text} % show text as menu path
\def\menu{\@salbegincatcodes \@menu}
\def\@menu#1{\texttt{#1}\endgroup}

% Code and file markup for use in description list and section

\newcommand\dlfile % {text}
